Introduction:	Project was to make to GUI based Language Translator in python.
		

		What is Translation?

			Translation is the communication of meaning from one language (the source) to another 
			language (the target). Translation refers to written information, whereas interpretation
			refers to spoken information.

			The purpose of translation is to convey the original tone and intent of a message,
			taking into account cultural and regional differences between source and target languages.

			Translation has been used by humans for centuries, beginning after the appearance of written 
			literature. Modern-day translators use sophisticated tools and technologies to accomplish their work,
			and rely heavily on software applications to simplify and streamline their tasks.

			Organizations around the world, encompassing a multitude of sectors, missions, and mandates,
			rely on translation for content as diverse as product labels, technical documentation,
			user reviews, promotional materials, annual reports, and much, much more.


Project Requirements:
	
	Operating System:				Windows 7 and Above,IOS,which supports python.
	Hardware Requirements(CPU/GPU/RAM etc.):	Atleast 2 RAM , Minimum Intel Graphics
	Programming Platform & Language:		Spyder or IDLE ,Python.
	Libraries & APIs:				Numpy,Pandas,googletrans,tkinter

Basic Algorithms and Techniques :
			
		The technique used for translation of text is, the source text is 
		being translated by fucntions of googletrans library which thereby calls
		an API to translate the text.

		A library named TKINTER is used for the GUI of the projects which has 
		numerous functions for designing your program window.

		And some basic python techniques to make changes as per needs and for 
		definining of functions.

Key Learnings from this Project :

Key Learnings from the project are - 
								GUI Designing of window through Tkinter.
								Using googletrans Library
								Some Complex pyhton fundamentals.
